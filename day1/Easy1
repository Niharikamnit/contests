You are given N full bottles of Coca-Cola, you can recycle X (X > 1) empty bottles of Coca-Cola for one full bottle of Coca-Cola. After you drink from a bottle of Coca-Cola it becomes empty.
Find the maximum number of Coca-Cola bottles you can drink from.

Sample 0
Input
N: 5
X: 4

Output
6

Explanation
First you can drink all 5 full bottles of Coca-Cola that you have, they all become empty. You can recycle 4 of them to receive another full bottle. So, you drink a total of 6 bottles of Coca-Cola. Note that, you still have two empty bottles left but you can't recycle them for another full bottle.

int totalbottles(int N, int X) {

		
		/*
    
    
    algo
    full=n
    recycle=n
    
    count=0;
    
    now count main full ko add karo
    ab
    jo bhi empty hai jo recycle wale main part lenge
    unme add kya hoenge/?
    jo bhi pehle se recycle bin main hai + jo abhi empty hue full main jitne the sb
    so recycle= reccyle+ full
    full kitna hoga?
    full utna hoga ki 19 toys hai and harr bache ko 4 dena hai to kitne bacho ko de paenge?
    19/4
    matlab 4 bache ko de paenge and 3 bach jaenge
    similarlry 
    yaha pe full ho jaega full=full/X;
    ab recycle kitna update ho jaega
    
    agar 19 toys the and sbko 4 batte to bache kitne...?19%4 = 3
    matlab ki recycle%x ho jaega recycle
    
    loop tb tk chalao jab tk full=0 nahi ho jata
    
    */
	int full=N;
	int recycle=0;
	
	int count=0;
		while(full!=0)
		{
		count+=full;
		
	recycle+=full;
			full=recycle/X;
			recycle=recycle%X;
	
		
		}
		
		return count;
	}
};

num=n/(x-1)+1;
